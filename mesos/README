This document explains how to start Singa from Mesos cluster management. The main steps are:
	1. Create singa scheduler. 
 
	2. Start Mesos master and slaves. This will also start Zookeeper service at the master node. 

	3. Submit and kill Singa jobs. This can be done as many times as the user wants. 

	4. Stop master and slaves. 


INSTALLING mesos:
	wget http://archive.apache.org/dist/mesos/0.22.0/mesos-0.22.0.tar.gz
	tar -zxvf mesos-0.22.0.tar.gz
	cd mesos-0.22.0
	patch -p5 < $SINGA_HOME/mesos/mesos_patch  


*****************************
Step 1: Create scheduler
	make

****************************
Step 2: Starting Mesos

Mesos must be started as root. 
	+ At the master: ./singa-mesos --master --start
	+ At each of the slave: ./singa-mesos --slave --start 

The user must specify several environment variables in "mesos.conf" file:
	+ MESOS_HOME: path to Mesos installation. It expects to find
		Mesos binaries in $MESOS_HOME/build/bin directory. Mesos logs are stored in $MESOS_HOME/logs
	+ MESOS_MASTER_IP: *routable* IP addresses of the master. It cannot be 127.0.0.1. 
	+ MESOS_SLAVE_IP: *routeable* IP address of the current slave. Different slaves have different values. 
	+ LIBPROCESS_IP: *routeable* IP address of the current node (slave or master). 
		Mesos master cannot communicate properly with schedulers without this being set. 
	+ ZK_HOME: path to Zookeeper installation. This is used to find $ZK_HOME/bin/zkServer.sh. 


***************************
Step 3: Starting Singa job 

The framework scheduler for Singa is implemented in SingaFramework.cc. The scheduler waits until it receive
sufficient resource offers from Mesos master, then does 2 things:
	1. Write IP addresses of the slaves to "$SINGA_WORKDIR/hostfile". 
	2. Start Singa process at each slave node, by running "launch_script.sh" 

Two important variables MUST be set in "singa.conf":
	+ SINGA_HOME: path to the Singa directory. 
	+ SINGA_WORKDIR: path to the example directory containing "model.conf" and "cluster.conf" for each model.  


To start:
	+ ./singa-submit [--nhosts=..] [--ncpus_per_host=..] [--nmem_per_host=..] [other singa flags]
	
	The default values for nhosts, ncpus_per_host and nmem_per_host are 1, 2, 1024.
	Other singa flags can also be passed.  

To stop:
	+ ./singa-stop

* Failure recovery:
	When a Singa nodes fail, the entire framework is automatically restarted. One can test by killing
a lt-singa process in a slave node, and observe how the entire job is restarted. 

* Running multiple Singa framework: 
	One can also run multiple Singa frameworks in the same Mesos cluster, by simply setting different
values for SINGA_WORKDIR and run "singa-submit" again.  


*************************
Step 4: Stopping Mesos 
	./singa-mesos --master --stop  // at the master node
	./singa-mesos --slave --stop  // at each slave node
